# Python Data Science Lab

## Code
It is recommended that you create your code in a Jupyter Notebook (which is bundled with Anaconda) for this lab. You should develop code to satisfy the following requirements:
* Import data of your choosing using the Pandas library.
* Explore this data based on your questions from Lab 7, and new questions you come up with as you explore.
* Use the Matplotlib library to develop visualizations as you go. Not all of these visualizations will be presentation-worthy, but you should keep them in your code to document your thought process.
* Show and document your data analysis process in your code. The code that you turn in should show anyone reviewing it your entire data "pipeline": meaning how you went from source data to preliminary analysis and finally on to presentation-worthy analysis.

This code will be evaluated and included with your other lab assignments.

## Presentation
* Your presentation must be a data story that includes visualizations. You are expected to show and explain at least 3 different visualizations.
* You may show code snippets to discuss your approach if you chose to, however, that is not required.
* Your presentation must include:
  1. An explanation of your data set
  2. An explanation of your questions
  3. The results of your analysis, supported by visualizations (this should be the ***majority*** of your presentation)
  4. Assumptions you had to made in your analysis or about the data itself
  5. The level of certainty you have (or do not have) about any conclusions you made in your presentation
  6. A description of potential ethical concerns in using this data/analysis to make decisions
* Presentations will be given in-person during the course's scheduled final exam period.
* Presentations should be between 8-10 minutes, and students will be expected to answer questions afterwards.

This presentation will be evaluated and will count as part of your final course grade.

## Submit
* Commit your well-documented code to the GitHub repository.
* Commit your presentation slides in ***PDF format*** (one page per slide) to the GitHub repository. You will present from this PDF.
